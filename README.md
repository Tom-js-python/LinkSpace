## 📌 Overview

**Linkspace** is a human-centered platform that helps people meet new friends nearby by discovering shared interests and values. It focuses on real connection—not dating or social media gamification.

The MVP allows users to:

- Create public profiles with meaningful content
- Select or suggest interest tags (with hybrid moderation)
- Browse others based on proximity and shared interests
- Start light-touch, platonic connections

The project is being built in Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.
