# üìñ LinkSpace User Stories & Gherkin Scenarios (MVP)

## üß≠ Purpose

This document outlines user stories and associated Gherkin-style behavior scenarios for the LinkSpace MVP.

- **User Stories** are short, human-centered descriptions of functionality from the perspective of a user. They guide design and development by focusing on user needs and goals.
- **Gherkin Scenarios** express the expected behavior of the system in a structured `Given / When / Then` format. These are primarily used to guide **end-to-end (E2E) testing**.

Each story is numbered to correspond to the five core feature sections in the [Creative Brief](./creativebrief.md). Future specification and test files can use extensions like `1.1.1`, `1.1.2`, etc., for detailed implementation requirements and test cases.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This document defines the core **functional expectations** of the LinkSpace MVP in terms of **user needs and behaviours**. These stories will evolve alongside the product and serve as the foundation for specifications, component logic, and automated testing.
